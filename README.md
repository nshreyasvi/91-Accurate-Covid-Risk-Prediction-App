# covid_machine_learning_model

C5.0 machine learning model 2 fold cross-validation trained over COVID-19_Case_Surveillance_Public_Use_Data (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf)
- Accuracy: 90.60%

- Checks for risk factor for a particular user of having specific age, gender, race and medical condition
- 4 levels of risk factor are given (0 - minimal risk, 3 - High Risk)

Based on risk factor, the user can either visit the doctor or stay at home to avoid infections.
